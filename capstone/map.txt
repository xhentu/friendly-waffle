### Future Considerations for class attendance
Batch Attendance Upload:
Allow teachers to upload attendance records (e.g., via CSV) for multiple sections or classes.

Automated Notifications:
Send notifications to parents/guardians for students marked "Absent."

Attendance Analytics:
Add charts to visualize trends (e.g., absenteeism by section or subject).

### function to check the class -> students -> a table with students attendance percentages !!!
